# Policy Libraries Overview

The Terraform Registry allows you to share [Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel) policies with the rest of the Terraform community. Sentinel is an embedded policy-as-code framework integrated into HashiCorp's Enterprise products. It enables fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions, and can be extended to use information from external sources.

Authors share their Sentinel policies and policy modules in the Terraform Registry as collections called _Policy Libraries_. [Sentinel CLI](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/commands) users can select individual policies from any of the Policy Libraries that they find in the Terraform Registry, include them in a Sentinel configuration file, and use them to enforce policy checks. [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs) users can assemble policies that they find in the Terraform Registry into [_Policy Sets_](/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#policies-and-policy-sets) that can [enforce policy](/cloud-docs/sentinel/enforce) on the infrastructure provisioned by their workspaces.
