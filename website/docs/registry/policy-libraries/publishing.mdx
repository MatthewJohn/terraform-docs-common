# Publishing Policy Libraries

A policy library is a collection of [Sentinel policies](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/writing) and [policy modules](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/extending/modules) that anyone can share through the Terraform Registry.

Policy libraries are built and maintained on GitHub. Once a policy library has been published, you can release a new version of the policies by pushing a properly formatted Git tag.

## Requirements for a Policy Library

- **Public GitHub repository**: The files defining Sentinel policies and policy modules must be stored in a public GitHub repository.

- **Repository name**: GitHub repositories containing Policy Libraries must be named according to the convention `policy-library-<NAME>`, where the `<NAME>` segment provides a name for your policy library.

- **Repository description**: The repository's description is displayed in search and browse pages of the Registry. This should be a short, one sentence description of purpose of the policy library.

- **sentinel.hcl file**: The GitHub repository must include a `sentinel.hcl` file at its root level. This file outlines the names and file locations for policies and policy modules that are included in the policy library. This is a [Sentinel configuration file](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/configuration), and it uses the same syntax that a Sentinel author is already familiar with. There are two caveats:
  1. [Remote sources](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/configuration/remote-sources) for policies and policy modules are not allowed.
  2. The `enforcement_level` for a policy does not need to be included.

- **`x.y.z` tags for releases**: The registry uses tags to identify versions of policy libraries. Release tag names must be a [semantic version](http://semver.org/), which can optionally be prefixed with a `v`. For example, `v1.0.4` and `0.9.2` are both acceptable. To publish a policy library initially, at least one acceptable tag must be present. Tags that don't match these conventions are ignored.

## Documenting a Policy Library

The Terraform Registry displays documentation for policy libraries, based on Markdown documents that you can choose to include in your GitHub repository.

-> In order to test how Markdown documents will render in the Terraform Registry, you can use the [Terraform Registry Doc Preview Tool](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview).

### Directory Structure

Markdown documents should be in the following locations within the repository. Any Markdown files that are not in these locations will be ignored.

| Location | Filename | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `README.md` | Index page for the policy library. |
| `docs/policies/` | `<policy name>.md` | Description of a single policy. |
| `docs/modules/` | `<module name>.md` | Description of a single policy module. |

The `<policy name>` and `<module name>` in the Markdown filenames must match the names of `policy` and `module` blocks in the library's `sentinel.hcl` file.

## Publishing to the Registry

### Signing in

Before publishing a policy library, you must first [sign in to the Terraform Registry with a GitHub account](/registry#user-account).

-> If you are publishing a policy library from a repository owned by a GitHub organization that you are a member of, you should verify that the Terraform Registry OAuth app has been granted access to the organization. Go to your [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/applications) and select the Terraform Registry Application under "Authorized OAuth Apps" to confirm.

### Publishing your Policy Library

From the top-right navigation bar of the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io), select [Publish > Policy](https://registry.terraform.io/publish/policy) to begin the publishing process. Follow the prompts to select the repository you would like to publish.

You must choose a category for your policy library. Categories are general  themes that can help users find policies that are relevant to their use-case. Choose the category that most closely matches the types of infrastructure to which your policies can be applied.

You may optionally associate your policy library with a set of [Terraform providers](/registry/providers). You may choose up to 20 publicly-available providers, in order to indicate to users which types of Terraform resources the policies in your library are applicable to.

#### Webhooks

Publishing a policy library will create a webhook in your GitHub repository subscribed to the `push` event. When you create new tagged versions of your repository, the webhook will inform the Terraform Registry, which will then be updated to include the new version of your policy library.

If the webhook is missing or not working, you can repair the connection through the Terraform Registry website. From your policy library's index page, select "Manage Policy Library > Resync Library". After a few seconds, a working webhook should be added to your GitHub repository.

#### Terms of Use

Anything published to the Terraform Registry is subject to our terms of use. A copy of the terms are available for viewing at <https://registry.terraform.io/terms>
